# Metacognition-limitations-of-robots
This repository contains the research code, datasets, and analysis for investigating the fundamental metacognitive limitations in current robotic systems. Our work explores how robots understand (or fail to understand) their own cognitive processes, decision-making capabilities, and knowledge boundaries.
